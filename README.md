# Radio Noise

This branch contains project builds.

## Description
Hello, traveler. I'd like to introduce you to my idea for a game called Radio Noise. 
Where several people on a procedurally generated map and appearing in a random part of the map, must find supplies, resources, weapons to build bases, shelters and equipment. 
In order to survive. Be the predator or be the prey. 
Build fortresses and industries to be the most advanced on the map.
